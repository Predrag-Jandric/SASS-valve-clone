## Welcome! 👋

- Every aspiring dev needs to successfully clone a webpage of his/hers choosing and abilities. This is the page that I've found interesting to clone and test my skills. The original is coded in Bootstrap but I have cloned it using Sass and JS. It is fully responsive on mobile and desktop as well.

### Languages and features 👨‍💻 

- Sass: mixins, partials, variables, responsive, BEM naming methodology.
- JS: forEach function, on-click toggling classes 

Thanks for checking out my projects.
